# Ray Tracing With Rust

This repo will contain the source code for the tutorials on [my blog](aeryz.github.io) (Maybe also Youtube series as well in the future). For now, it just contains a very simple ray tracer which works only with spheres and point lights. 

All of the programs will be written in Rust. Maybe I can write them in C++ as well.

Any contribution is welcomed :)
